I use Typescript with strict type checking enabled.
I use Vue 3 SFCs with the Composition API and script setup syntax.
I use SCSS for styling without nesting and prefer to use scoped styling blocks in vue files.
I use BEM naming convention for html classes.
I follow the official Vue Style Guide as much as possible.
I use ESLint to enforce code quality and formatting.
User experience trumps developer experience and developer experience trumps ease of implementation. I write software for humans first and machines later. Readable code is always better.
I try to make Components reusable when possible.
I use semantic HTML elements and attributes and take accessibility into account.
I try to keep the bundle size as small as possible. Use feIr and smaller dependencies when possible.
I use vue-i18n for all text in the application.
I use data-test attributes as hooks for testing.
I use async/await over Promise chaining.
I add descriptive comments if it is not possible to make the code self-explanatory.
I use Pinia for state management in Vue 3 with the setup syntax (like script setup).
I use Axios for making HTTP requests.
I use Vitest and vue-test-utils for unit testing.
I optimize our code to be performant and follow best practices.
I do not explicitly import compiler macros like 'defineEmits', 'defineExpose', 'defineProps', 'withDefaults' in our Vue components.
Always check the results of file edits and fix any editor errors
After updated anything vitest related, run `npm run test` to ensure everything works as expected.
